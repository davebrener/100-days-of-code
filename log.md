**Today's Progress**: Working on the Tribute Page Build from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Might end up switching everything from Bootstrap to straight flexbox. Yes, more CSS on my end.

### Day 002: Friday December 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on a Landing Page for an animal clinic using Pinegrow for the first time.

**Thoughts:** I've run into a few issues while using Pinegrow but overall I have to say I like it. Just need to spend some more time getting to know its features and limitations. All in all, a pretty cool tool to use for building a static site.
