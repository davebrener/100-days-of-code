### Day 002: Friday December 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on a Landing Page for an animal clinic using Pinegrow for the first time.

**Thoughts:** I've run into a few issues while using Pinegrow but overall I have to say I like it. Just need to spend some more time getting to know its features and limitations. All in all, a pretty cool tool to use for building a static site.

### Day 003: Saturday December 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued my work on the animal clinic using a combo of Pinegrow and hand-coding.

**Thoughts:** Still continuing to learn the ins-and-outs of Pinegrow. Working with it more often will increase my knowledge of the platform.

### Day 004: Sunday December 31st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began working through Per Harald Borgen's course on CSS Grid layout.

**Thoughts:** I'll need much more practice before I'm comfortable enough to utilize CSS Grid on a project. In particular, still trying to wrap my head around placement of divs within the defined grid columns. Seems tricky to me, at least right now.
